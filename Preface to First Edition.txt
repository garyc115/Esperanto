PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION

Esperanto is the International Auxiliary Language created by Dr. L. L. Zamenhof, a doctor of
medicine, residing at Warsaw, Poland. It is hardly now necessary to mention this fact, but there
was a time, not very long ago, when many people thought that Esperanto was a patent medicine,
or new kind of soap, or, in fact, anything except a language !
  Its aim is not to displace existing languages, but to be a second language for the world, and
its merits are now recognised by many eminent men of all nationalities. If we consider the
enormous advantages of a common language, understood by all, we shall at once confess what
a blessing Dr. Zamenhof has conferred upon mankind, for :-
  Firstly,-It enables anyone to correspond on any topic, social, commercial, or scientific, with
persons of all nationalities.
  Secondly,-Books of all descriptions can at once be translated into this common language, and
sold all over the world; consequently scientific and medical men will not have to wait, perhaps
years, before some important treatise appears in their own language.
