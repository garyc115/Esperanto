\textbf{The Wolf Turned Shepherd}\\
\\
A wolf, finding that the sheep\\
were so afraid of him that he\\
could not get near them,\\
disguised himself in the dress\\
of a shepherd, and thus\\
attired approached the flock.\\
As he came near, he found\\
the shepherd fast asleep. As\\
the sheep did not run away,\\
he resolved to imitate the\\
voice of the shepherd. In\\
trying to do so, he only\\
howled, and awoke the shepherd.\\
as he could not run away, he\\
was soon killed.\\

\textit{Those who attempt to act in\\
disguise are apt to overdo it.}\\
